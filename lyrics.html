    <h2>All We Do Is Talk</h2>
    <p>I know you're my person and I won't find no one like you
    You know I'm your guy, your best friend and your lover, too
    What did we lose?
    All we ever do is talk
    Man, I'm so exhausted
    Circles 'til we're nauseous
    And what happened?
    To meetin' you at the hotel, 3 a.m.
    Pull the belt from your robe, pushin' me on the bed
    It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    With your back on the wall, pullin' off my suit
    You could hear us from the hallway, flippin' the room
    It was good, it was good, didn't want it to end
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    Coming back to center after we dissect the roots, yeah
    Oh, fall asleep on my shoulder, breathe out while I hold you
    Wake up, do it over again and again and again
    What happened?
    To meetin' you at the hotel, 3 a.m.
    Pull the belt from your robe, pushin' me on the bed
    It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    With your back on the wall, pullin' off my suit
    You could hear us from the hallway, flippin' the room
    It was good, it was good, didn't want it to end
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    It was good, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    It was good, it was good, it was good, we were good
    It was good, good, good, good, good
    All we ever do is talk
    Man, I'm so exhausted
    Circles 'til we're nauseous
    And what happened?
    To meetin' you at the hotel, 3 a.m.
    Pull the belt from your robe, pushin' me on the bed
    It was good, it was good, didn't know what it meant
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    With your back on the wall, pullin' off my suit
    You could hear us from the hallway, flippin' the room
    It was good, it was good, didn't want it to end
    But will we ever get that feelin' again?
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    It was good, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good, it was good
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
    It was good, it was good, it was good, we were good
    It was good, good, good, good, good</p>

    <h2>Beach House</h2>
    <p>In a k-hole listening to Beach House
    Light my cigarette for me while I bleed out
    I'm a cataract on the heal

    Ideating in the rain through the comedown
    She yelled her ex's name when she came
    How the hell am I supposed to feel?

    And isn't it so sad?
    Isn't it so sad I'll never be that?
    And isn't it so sad I'll never be?

    All I need is a place to go
    Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
    Let me leave, I don't wanna know
    Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

    And there's no way out, there's no way out
    Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
    In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness

    In a k-hole listening to Nick Cave
    I cut my tongue sucking on a toothache
    Red wine and a plate of veal

    In a blind rage feeling like a boy scout
    I sold myself heavy I'm a whore now
    A coward with a face of tears

    And isn't it so sad?
    Isn't it so sad I'll never be that?
    And isn't it so sad I'll never be?

    All I need is a place to go
    Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
    Let me leave, I don't wanna know
    Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

    And there's no way out, there's no way out
    Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
    In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness

    The hotel room where I camped out
    Blurry tattoos, the highway sounds
    Run with no shoes, I cave in now, I cave in now

    All I need is a place to go
    Her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness
    Let me leave, I don't wanna know
    Her sweat, sunset, for a taste of the habit

    And there's no way out, there's no way out
    Don't bite the hand, don't let me drown
    In her sweat, cigarette, till I'm back in the madness</p>

    <h2>Ode To A Conversation Stuck In Your Throat</h2>
    <p>I do not want to fight this anymore
    I just want to lay back and watch you pin me to the bed
    I used to call you my best friend way back before you were my everything
    Now I'm sucking your neck

    And you wrote my favorite song
    Now I'm fucked up and carrying on
    I do not know the words to it yet, oh

    And it hits me
    I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me
    Is it ok?
    That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me

    Yeah

    Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
    Oh tell me that nobody else touches you like me
    Tell me that nobody else touches you like I do, like I do
    Oh tell me that nobody else touches you like me

    You're pulling on my habit lines
    The more I smoke the more I find
    I can't just fall asleep instead
    And you're not my protector I hope you know it wasn't her
    That kept me off your side of the bed, oh

    And it hits me
    I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me
    Is it ok?
    That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me

    You're in his living room
    And it may not mean much to you
    But your plates are in his sink
    And your sweater's on his bed
    Won't you text me when you're home
    My baby, spare me all the rest

    Please just tell me that nobody else touches you like I do
    Oh tell me that nobody else touches you like me

    And it hits me
    I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me
    Is it ok?
    That I don't want anybody else touching you like I do
    Like I do
    Like me

    <h2>NFU</h2>
    <p>I don't wanna go home
    But I don't wanna stay here
    Does your boyfriend know where you've gone?
    Does he think it means nothing?

    Oh, what he don't know won't hurt him
    But it kills me

    I'm not fucked up
    I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
    And I'm sorry
    I still love you, you say it's okay, but it's not
    Oh, it's not, yeah

    The underpart of your arms
    How I miss that smell
    I swear I won't be alarmed
    If you say this means nothing

    Oh, what he don't know won't hurt him
    But it kills me

    I'm not fucked up
    I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
    I'm sorry
    I still love you, you say it's okay, but it's not
    Oh, it's not, yeah

    (Was what we had the best?
    Or is it all in my head?
    That's the funny thing about memories
    You can never trust 'em)

    Was what we had the best?
    Or is it all in my head?
    That's the funny thing about memories
    You can never trust 'em

    I'm afraid that I'll die without you
    Die not knowing if you were the one
    There's no way that you're not
    I'm sorry

    I'm not fucked up
    I just miss the way that you talk, yeah
    And I'm sorry
    I still love you, you say it's okay, but it's not
    Oh, it's not

    Oh, I'm sorry
    I'm sorry
    I'm sorry
    Oh, you say it's okay, but it's not
    Oh, it's not, yeah

    I'm not fucked up
    I just miss the way that we talked, yeah

    <h2>Gemini</h2>
    <p>So here's the setting, we met fucked up at a wedding
    Shoulders back, throwing her hair, yeah
    She said, "it hasn't been pretty, stuck in a walk-up in Philly
    Ain't exactly feel like Paris, yeah."

    And she don't understand I get so distant
    And it ain't any comfort to know that she's suffering too
    And nothing she can write me makes a difference
    And it's all in my head but I wanna believe she'll be mine in a year, maybe two

    I'll drop her a line when I'm feeling like myself again
    'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
    Gemini, when I'm feeling like myself again
    Maybe I could be more than just a friend

    I've been a monster, talks about me to her mother
    Shopping for Bertoia chairs, yeah
    Found an imposture, hair just like me, thought I lost her
    Oh what a nervous affair, yeah

    And nothing she can write me makes a difference
    And it's all in my head but I wanna believe she'll be mine in a year, maybe two

    I'll drop her a line when I'm feeling like myself again
    'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
    Gemini, when I'm feeling like myself again
    Maybe I could be more than just a friend

    Gemini, Gemini, when I'm feeling like myself
    Gemini, when I'm feeling -

    I'll drop her a line when I'm feeling like myself again
    'Cause lately I ain't in the mood to pretend
    Gemini, when I'm feeling like myself again
    Maybe I could be more than just a friend

    (Gemini, Gemini, Gemini)
    I could be more than just a friend

    I could be more than just a friend

    <h2>Glitter & Honey</h2>
    <p>She's on pills smoking menthols
    Head to toe in ysl on the rooftop
    I don't care what we do long as we do not tell
    She says, "honey play with me, I'm your ken doll"
    Thrown out by the maître d' from the restaurant
    Could not keep her hands of me on the way to the hotel

    She's one of those glitter and honey
    Type to get stuck to your soul
    She's one of those glitter and honey

    "Do you wanna sweat with me to the Beatles?"
    She dresses like Hermione but evil
    Said she knows my music, hates it
    I'm sick, wasted, waiting for her ride to come

    She said, "the city is pain but the night's so gorgeous
    I'm not vain, just a little bit bored of this."

    She's one of those glitter and honey
    Type to get stuck to your soul
    She's one of those
    Family money
    But she'd never want you to know

    I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
    I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah

    She's one of those
    Glitter and honey

    When I saw that look in your eye I was awful surprised
    Was it love or just a romance, we could give it a try, yeah
    By the time you were taking my hand I was outta my mind
    Didn't care where the evening went, we would take our time

    She said, "the city is pain but the night's so gorgeous
    I'm not vain, just a little bit bored of this."

    She's one of those glitter and honey
    Type to get stuck to your soul
    She's one of those -

    I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah
    I kinda like it, I kinda like it, I kinda like it, yeah

    She's one of those
    Glitter and honey</p>

    <h2>Coping on Unemployment</h2>
    <p>LDaily, she sends me photos of her
    She's only twenty-something
    Terrible with her iPhone
    Left me another voicemail
    Saying, "sorry I didn't text you
    I haven't been sleeping well"

    It's a slow burn
    Coping on unemployment
    Cracking her fingers often
    I ask her what we're doing
    She tries to change the subject
    Saying, "I'm scared of turning into
    A parody of myself"

    And it's hard to give yourself over to something
    It's hard to give yourself over to something

    Sunday, she puts on sky ferreira
    She finishes herself first
    She slept in her mascara
    And says, "I think your music got worse
    Since you went fully sober
    At least now you won't kill yourself"

    You need to get some help

    And it's hard to give yourself over to something
    It's hard to give yourself over to something
    When it could all turn into nothing

    And now I'm afraid to throw you in a different light
    I'm waiting on the moment when we get it right
    You're sleeping all alone, I'm sitting up at night
    I'm so in my head, I'm so in my head

    It's hard to give yourself over

    And it's hard to give yourself over to something
    It's hard to give yourself over to something
    And now I'm-
